# **Two doors**

Challenge Name: ****Two doors**

**Challenge Solved Description:**

This challenge required tracking down a flag hidden in a Discord moderator's profile picture, starting from a broken URL.

---

### Step 1: The Broken Link

The challenge provided the following URL:

`https://chatgpt.com/share/6990cbe8-60d4-8010-ac07-7e9c6eb9d98f`

Navigating to it returned a **404 error**. Rather than giving up, I noticed the URL structure and attempted to **swap the last two characters** of the share ID (`8f` → `f8` or similar), which revealed a valid, accessible shared ChatGPT conversation.

### Step 2: Extracting Clues from the Chat

The recovered conversation contained a clue pointing to **Discord**, specifically referencing a moderator account:

- **MOD Name:** Seshan
- **Discord Username:** `vividverse1625`

---

### Step 3: Discord Profile Investigation

Searching for `vividverse1625` on Discord and navigating to their profile revealed that the user held a **Moderator role**. The **profile picture (avatar)** was identified as the flag location.

Examining the avatar closely, the flag was embedded in the image text/design.

**Flag:** `BPCTF{birthday_gift_from_atlee}`

### Takeaway

- Don't assume a 404 error means a broken link in these challenges. Try simple modifications like swapping characters, changing case, or adjusting IDs before exploring other options.
- Shared links can reveal sensitive data. Publicly sharing ChatGPT conversations risks exposing private information. In CTF events, such links often serve as clues.
